# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Haven't coded in Free Code Camp since summer 2016 (I attended an immersive bootcamp 9/16-12/16), so going to try that again. Last exercise completed in 2016: "Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript." Points: 240

**Thoughts:** It's hard to stay focused for an hour straight, yet an hour also passes very quickly. It feels like I know more than I think I do - which is what people keep telling me, but I dislike hearing. Ending points: 254

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Paired with a former bootcamp classmate on using TDD while creating a shopping cart.

**Thoughts:** I felt like I knew nothing, but this is pretty normal for me. I really want to delve into TDD but it keeps getting put on the back burner as I try to grasp basic JS.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another hour in FCC. Trying to also get more familiar with developing in the console. Points: 254

**Thoughts:** Got through two of the algorithm challenges. Realized I've been writing for loops without actually understanding WHY they work the way they do. This was my downfall in math - always needing to know WHY instead of just pushing the 'I BELIEVE' button. Ugh. Ending points: 261

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up repo for website for new Junior Dev group. Also created Slack channel and Twitter account. Not too much actual code, but sometimes that's how it goes - tons of setup beforehand.

**Thoughts:** Wishing I had graphic design/photoshop abilities so I could create a logo for this new group.
