# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Haven't coded in Free Code Camp since summer 2016 (I attended an immersive bootcamp 9/16-12/16), so going to try that again. Last exercise completed in 2016: "Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript." Points: 240

**Thoughts:** It's hard to stay focused for an hour straight, yet an hour also passes very quickly. It feels like I know more than I think I do - which is what people keep telling me, but I dislike hearing. Ending points: 254

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Paired with a former bootcamp classmate on using TDD while creating a shopping cart.

**Thoughts:** I felt like I knew nothing, but this is pretty normal for me. I really want to delve into TDD but it keeps getting put on the back burner as I try to grasp basic JS.

**Link to work:** not available

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Another hour in FCC. Trying to also get more familiar with developing in the console. Points: 254

**Thoughts:** Got through two of the algorithm challenges. Realized I've been writing for loops without actually understanding WHY they work the way they do. This was my downfall in math - always needing to know WHY instead of just pushing the 'I BELIEVE' button. Ugh. Ending points: 261

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up repo for website for new Junior Dev group. Also created Slack channel and Twitter account. Not too much actual code, but sometimes that's how it goes - tons of setup beforehand.

**Thoughts:** Wishing I had graphic design/photoshop abilities so I could create a logo for this new group.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting algorithm: Palindrome. Sent me down the regex rabbit hole, which was way fun. Points: 262 (Somehow I got an extra point since last logging in? I'll take it, haha.)

**Thoughts:** Even if I'm just getting through one algorithm per hour(day), I'm still learning a ton. Giving myself an hour to work on one thing makes me feel okay about deep-studying and really learning whatever problem I'm trying to solve. Couldn't remember the ternary syntax for my if/return, so that was frustrating. Ending points: 263

### Day 6: Jan 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More FCC algorithm practice. Points: 263

**Thoughts:** Got through one problem. Ending points: 264

**Link to work:** [Find the Longest Word in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)

### Day 7: Jan 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was given a code assignment (SQL) from a job interview so that's what I worked on.

**Thoughts:** I used to think I wanted to get into database management. Now I miss my JavaScript. Maybe a way to do both?

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 8: Jan 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on the code assignment, except now it's the Access front end and VBA.

**Thoughts:** Blerg.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 9: Jan 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on the code assignment.

**Thoughts:** Still blerg.

### Day 10: Jan 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with website on github.io, and fiddled with Jekyll.

### Day 11: Jan 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More work on the code assignment.

**Thoughts:** Have given it all the time I can - not pleased with the result but need to move on.

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 12: Jan 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour with JavaScript30 and a few hours with a Bianca Gandolfo class (including exercises) on Front-End Masters. Also spent an hour reading up on modules in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I'm easily understanding concepts I struggled with a mere two weeks ago, which reinforces my old belief that I just need more time - that this stuff is impossible to get a good handle on in three measley months of bootcamp.

### Day 13: Jan 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a quick hour making minor updates to a website I use, and submitting a PR.

**Thoughts:** Happy when folks keep their code on GH so I can try to help out!

### Day 14: Jan 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent time on the UJD site, creating basic layout, creating and uploading images, etc.

**Thoughts:** I need to get better at design. Only one way to do that!

### Day 15: Jan 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Since my old WP blog was hacked somehow, I've decided to repurpose an old blog built using React and deployed on Heroku.

**Thoughts:** I've got a lot of work to do but it will be nice to have a more private place than Medium to post things.

### Day 16: Jan 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: So once I went to get a blog post date off of my WP site, lo and behold it's not blacklisted anymore, yay! Spent a ton of time revamping it.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to have my site back, tell you what!

**Link to work:** [WordPress site](http://ashlylamarr.me/about/)

### Day 17: Jan 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messed around with figuring out the API to pull my blog posts from WP into my personal site (React app on Heroku)

**Thoughts:** Will need to keep investigating.

**Link to work:** n/a

### Day 18: Jan 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent 4 hours pair programming with a friend on an Angular tutorial.

**Thoughts:** We'd spent 3 days or so with Angular during code school, so this was a nice refresher and much more enjoyable this time around. Also, pair programming continues to rock. We're going to pick it up again next week.

**Link to work:** [Angular app](https://github.com/SurlyMae/angular-web-app)

### Day 19: Jan 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a follow-along nav bar thing with WesBos.

**Thoughts:** I know we aren't supposed to count tutorials for this challenge but I spent 2 hours at a meeting to help plan a tech conf and the rest of my day applying to jobs so this will have to do.

### Day 20: Jan 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was scheduled to pair with an old classmate but they forgot. Spent a couple of hours with 5 days of javascript30 and a but messing around with an old flexbox assignment.

**Thoughts:** Gonna conquer Flexbox this week. Tired of it getting the best of me.

### Day 21: Jan 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Paired for a couple of hours with a friend on some Code Wars. Two katas dealing with object manipulation. Also spent an hour reviewing Markdown so I could use it in my blog.

**Thoughts:** There was a concept in the last problem I wasn't understanding, then I finally understood - so when I got home I decided to write a blog post about it to cement my comprehension.  

**Link to work:** [Object Manipulation](http://ashlylamarr.me/javascript-object-manipulation/)

### Day 22: Feb 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spend the entire day studying Flexbox and messing around with it.

**Thoughts:** Just like with the day before, found that writing a post about a few Flexbox properties helped my brain retain what I'd learned.
